# Problem Statement
In competitive cricket, selecting the optimal team is crucial for achieving consistent victories. A key aspect of team selection lies in analysing player performance data to ensure that the team is well-balanced, capable of scoring high runs while also being able to defend challenging scores.
This project aims to create a Power BI dashboard that helps identify the best 11 players for a cricket team based on a range of performance metrics. The goal is to select a team that is capable of:
Scoring an average of 210 runs in batting performances across multiple matches. Defending an average of 145 runs in bowling and fielding performances, ensuring a robust defense against opponent teams.
