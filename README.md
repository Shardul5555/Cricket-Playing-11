Problem Statement
In competitive cricket, selecting the optimal team is crucial for achieving consistent victories. A key aspect of team selection lies in analyzing player performance data to ensure that the team is well-balanced, capable of scoring high runs while also being able to defend challenging scores.

Scoring an average of 210 runs in batting performances across multiple matches.
Defending an average of 145 runs in bowling and fielding performances, ensuring a robust defense against opponent teams.
